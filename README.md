# AWS Serverless Text Processing Pipeline

## Overview

This project demonstrates a fully event-driven serverless architecture built on AWS.

When a `.txt` file is uploaded to an S3bucket:

* AWS Lambda is triggered automatically
* The file is processed and words are counted
* Metadata is stored in DynamoDB
* A processed result file is written to a separate S3 bucket
* An SNS notification is sent
* Delete events trigger additional notifications

## Architecture

User → S3 Upload Bucket → Lambda →
• DynamoDB (store metadata)
• S3 Processed Bucket (store result file)
• SNS (email notifications)

Processed bucket delete events → SNS alert
