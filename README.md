## Overview

This project implements a fully event-driven, serverless text processing pipeline on AWS.

The system automatically processes uploaded `.txt` files, extracts metadata, persists results, and generates real-time notifications — without provisioning or managing servers.

The architecture follows cloud-native design principles including:

- Event-driven workflows
- Service decoupling
- Managed services
- Horizontal scalability
- Operational visibility

## Architecture

### Flow

1. A user uploads a `.txt` file to the S3 upload bucket  
2. S3 triggers a Lambda function  
3. The Lambda function:
   - Counts words in the file  
   - Stores metadata in DynamoDB  
   - Writes processed output to a separate S3 bucket  
   - Publishes an SNS notification  
4. Deletion events from the processed bucket trigger additional SNS alerts

## AWS Services Used

- Amazon S3
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon SNS
- Amazon CloudWatch Logs

Region: **eu-north-1 (Stockholm)**

---

## Technical Highlights

- Fully serverless architecture
- Event-driven processing model
- DynamoDB metadata persistence
- Automated notification system
- Structured logging via CloudWatch
- Separation of upload and processed storage tiers
- Delete-event monitoring

---

## Repository Structure


---

## Design Considerations

- Stateless compute via AWS Lambda
- Managed NoSQL storage with DynamoDB
- Decoupled notification service (SNS)
- Clear separation of ingestion and processed data
- CloudWatch logging for observability

---

## Future Enhancements

- Introduce Amazon SQS for message buffering and decoupling
- Add API Gateway for querying metadata
- Implement IAM least-privilege policies
- Convert infrastructure to Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform or CloudFormation)
- Add automated tests and CI/CD pipeline
